	<h1 class="detail">Problem Statement</h1>
	<p class="detail">
	The aim of this challenge is to convert the entire content in this file from the
	current Markdown format to an web page. You will be required to work not only
	with HTML but with CSS and JavaScript as well. Why JavaScript you ask? We will
	get to it soon.
	</p>
	<h2 class="detail">So what are the requirements?</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>You will be using HTML5 Biolerplate <sub>[1]</sub>. The code is already checked out and
  	added to this project. You can use the features of HTML5 Boilerplate and all
  	its components the way you want.</li>
	<li>You will be required to style the webpage using CSS as well. We would like the
  	final webpage to look good.</li>
	<li>Now comes the JavaScript part: You would have noticed that the table of
  	contents are empty. We would like it to be populated, in a way similar to say
  	Wikipedia's Table of Contents at the start of all documents. But we don't want
  	you to hard code the headings and links. We want the table of contents to be
  	generated using Javascript. So in case we add some headings later, it gets
  	updated automatically when rendered in browser.</li>
	<li>Anything cool that you can do with will bring you extra favours; more
  	awesomeness is always welcome.</li>
	<li>You will be required to publish the code to an account of your own on
  	Bitbucket <sub>[2]</sub> and share it with us so that we can have a look.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1 class="detail">What will you be judged on?</h1>
	<ul>
	<li>The code, of course. HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as any other stuff that you
	wish to use.</li>
	<li>Your design. Because as much as users value functionality, it is not impactful
  	without design.</li>
	<li>Execution. Requirements have to be met because milestones are laid to be
  	reached.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1 class="detail">Brief descriptions of things that you will use</h1>
	<p class="detail">(Excerpts from Wikipedia)</p>
	<h2 class="detail">### HTML5</h2>
	<p class="detail">HTML5 is a markup language for structuring and presenting content for the World
	Wide Web, and is a core technology of the Internet originally proposed by Opera
	Software. It is the fifth revision of the HTML standard (created in 1990 and
	standardized as HTML4 as of 1997) and, as of September 2012, is still under
	development. Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for
	the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and
	consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.).
	HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML
	as well.</p>
	<h2 class="detail">### CSS</h2>
	<p class="detail">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
	presentation semantics (the look and formatting) of a document written in a
	markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages written in
	HTML and XHTML, but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML
	document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.</p>
	<h2 class="detail">###  JavaScript</h2>
	<p class="detail">JavaScript (sometimes abbreviated JS) is a prototype-based scripting language
	that is dynamic, weakly typed and has first-class functions. It is a
	multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional
	programming styles</p>
	<p class="detail">JavaScript was formalized in the ECMAScript language standard and is primarily
	used in the form of client-side JavaScript, implemented as part of a Web browser
	in order to give enhanced user interfaces and dynamic websites. This enables
	programmatic access to computational objects within a host environment.</p>
	<h2 class="detail">### jQuery</h2>
	<p class="detail">jQuery is a multi-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the
	client-side scripting of HTML. It was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by
	John Resig. Used by over 55% of the 10,000 most visited websites, jQuery is the
	most popular JavaScript library in use today.</p>
	<p class="detail">jQuery is free, open source software, licensed under the MIT License. jQuery's
	syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM
	elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications.</p>
	<p class="detail">jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of
	the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for
	low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level,
	theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the
	creation of powerful dynamic web pages and web applications.</p>

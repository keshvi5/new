Laugh Out Loud Ventures Pvt. Ltd.
================================

Hi! Welcome to the web development challenge for a position at Laugh Out Loud
Ventures. The motive of this round is simple, we intend to know if you will be
able to quickly adapt to the various technologies available today and do it in a
way that pleases the eyes of our users as well as our clients.

Table Of Contents
-----------------


Problem Statement
-----------------
The aim of this challenge is to convert the entire content in this file from the
current Markdown format to an web page. You will be required to work not only
with HTML but with CSS and JavaScript as well. Why JavaScript you ask? We will
get to it soon.

So what are the requirements?
* You will be using HTML5 Biolerplate [1]. The code is already checked out and
  added to this project. You can use the features of HTML5 Boilerplate and all
  its components the way you want.
* You will have to learn a little bit of git [4] to checkout code from Bitbucket
  as well as an account on the service. Note that Bitbucket accounts are free.
  You will be pushing the code to a repository that you will create in your
  account, which is required to be **private**. You can add a user
  _mayanksinghal_ as one of the contributors to the repository so that Mayank
  can help you out when required and when you are done, he can check your code.
* You will be required to style the webpage using CSS as well. We would like the
  final webpage to look good.
* Now comes the JavaScript part: You would have noticed that the table of
  contents are empty. We would like it to be populated, in a way similar to say
  Wikipedia's Table of Contents at the start of all documents. But we don't want
  you to hard code the headings and links. We want the table of contents to be
  generated using Javascript. So in case we add some headings later, it gets
  updated automatically when rendered in browser.
* Anything cool that you can do with will bring you extra favours; more
  awesomeness is always welcome.
* You will be required to publish the code to an account of your own on
  Bitbucket [2] and share it with us so that we can have a look.

What will you be judged on?
---------------------------
* The code, of course. HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as any other stuff that you
  wish to use.
* Your design. Because as much as users value functionality, it is not impactful
  without design.
* Execution. Requirements have to be met because milestones are laid to be
  reached.

Brief descriptions of things that you will use
----------------------------------------------
(Excerpts from Wikipedia)
### HTML5
HTML5 is a markup language for structuring and presenting content for the World
Wide Web, and is a core technology of the Internet originally proposed by Opera
Software. It is the fifth revision of the HTML standard (created in 1990 and
standardized as HTML4 as of 1997) and, as of September 2012, is still under
development. Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for
the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and
consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.).
HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML
as well.

### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
presentation semantics (the look and formatting) of a document written in a
markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages written in
HTML and XHTML, but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML
document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.

###  JavaScript
JavaScript (sometimes abbreviated JS) is a prototype-based scripting language
that is dynamic, weakly typed and has first-class functions. It is a
multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional
programming styles.

JavaScript was formalized in the ECMAScript language standard and is primarily
used in the form of client-side JavaScript, implemented as part of a Web browser
in order to give enhanced user interfaces and dynamic websites. This enables
programmatic access to computational objects within a host environment.

### jQuery
jQuery is a multi-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the
client-side scripting of HTML. It was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by
John Resig. Used by over 55% of the 10,000 most visited websites, jQuery is the
most popular JavaScript library in use today.

jQuery is free, open source software, licensed under the MIT License. jQuery's
syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM
elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications.
jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of
the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for
low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level,
theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the
creation of powerful dynamic web pages and web applications.
